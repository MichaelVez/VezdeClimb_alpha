#  VezdeClimb 3D - Bootcamp Front-end mid project

 This is a front-end react project where the user is able to build a 3D Clibming routes and share it to anyone 
- This is a project i did for the bootcamp mid project, when we finished learning react part of the coure. I loved working on this project because i learned some much new technologies and imroved my coding skills. It was a crazy fun project to work on mainly because  first i didnt think this was possible using JS/React and it was very challenging. working with three.js is not easy, it had a hard learning curve that involves some math and new syntax, alot of doc reading and alot of different bug fixes. overall a good experince that i look forward on developing this concept app

features
- navigate to the wall route on the top navbar after the initial tutorial page
- a user is able to navigate around the wall using the mouse and move the position by holding 'CTRL'  
- side menu has hold menu save and reset
- to make a costum rock - on the hold menu choose a hold and change its radius angles and color by moving the sliders 
 
Future Plans:
- Wall angle settings 
- user created hand hold/rocks
- Refactor layout
- Better Styling/ refactor to styled components
